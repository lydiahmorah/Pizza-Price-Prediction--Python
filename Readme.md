# A Comprehensive Analysis of Pizza Pricing Factors and Predictive Modeling
- This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting pizza prices based on various factors such as size, toppings, and company. 
- By analyzing a dataset of pizza orders, we explore the relationships between these variables and the price of the pizza.

- The primary objective is to create a reliable model that can assist businesses in pricing their pizza offerings competitively and profitably. 

- This model can also provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and market trends.

- The project follows a structured methodology, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. 

- Through this process, I aim to build a robust and effective machine learning solution for pizza price prediction.
